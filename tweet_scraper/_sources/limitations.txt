===========

* Inability to distinguish retweets

   * A processor can be used to detect tweets that begin with terms like "RT"

      * Not all retweets follow this pattern

* Inexact counts for Likes and Retweets

   * As values get to 1000 and above, they are displayed in an abbreviated form

      * 1K or 1.2M

* Can only collect tweets Twitter loads

   * They do not go back indefinitely, and the limit seems to flucuate

   * Search results are based on what Twitter thinks is relevant
